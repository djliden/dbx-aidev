# Product Requirements Document
## Databricks AI Development Setup Tool

### Executive Summary

**Product Name:** Databricks AI Development Setup Tool
**Package Name:** `dbx-aidev`
**Command Name:** `dbai`
**Target Users:** Data scientists, ML engineers, and developers using AI codegen tools with Databricks

### Problem Statement

AI code generation tools like Claude Code have immense potential for Databricks notebook development, but they lack the specific configuration and context needed to work effectively with Databricks workspaces. They need efficient access to Databricks CLI and SDK documentation, plus understanding of deployment patterns from local repositories to Databricks workspaces. Developers need a simple way to configure any local directory for Databricks AI development.

### Product Vision

Transform any local directory into a Databricks-ready AI development environment where Claude Code and other AI tools can effectively author, test, and deploy notebooks with full understanding of Databricks-specific patterns, efficient access to searchable documentation, and clear deployment strategies from local repos to Databricks workspaces.

## Core Design Philosophy

### Local Repository as Source of Truth
- **Local development first:** All notebook development happens in local git repositories
- **Deploy to Databricks:** Push completed work to Databricks workspace for execution
- **No workspace sync:** Avoid complexity of bidirectional sync with existing workspace content
- **Git-centric workflow:** Leverage existing version control and collaboration patterns

## Target Users & Use Cases

### Primary Users
- **Data Scientists** using AI tools for exploratory data analysis and model development
- **ML Engineers** building production pipelines with AI-assisted notebook development
- **Analytics Engineers** creating data transformation notebooks with AI assistance
- **Developers** integrating Databricks notebooks into larger AI-assisted workflows

### User Workflows
1. **New Project:** Start with empty local directory, run `dbai`, develop notebooks locally, deploy to Databricks
2. **Existing Local Project:** Has local notebooks in git, run `dbai`, enable Databricks deployment
3. **Team Collaboration:** Clone repo, run `dbai`, develop locally, push to git and deploy to Databricks
4. **Multi-Environment Development:** Switch between local projects, each configured for different Databricks workspaces

## Core Features & Requirements

- Deployment pipeline tested and validated

#### Feature 4: Development Utilities & Validation
**Priority:** High
**Description:** Tools for local Databricks development and deployment workflow

**Requirements:**
- Connection testing for workspace deployment
- Local notebook validation (syntax, imports, etc.)
- Deployment dry-run and testing capabilities
- Workspace permission validation
- Development workflow documentation and helpers

**Success Criteria:**
- Local development environment validated
- Deployment pipeline tested before first use
- Clear feedback on any configuration issues

#### Feature 5: Multi-AI Tool Support
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** Support for AI tools beyond Claude Code
